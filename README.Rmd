## Introduction

W.E.B Du Bois was one of the most multifaceted and persuasive civil rights 
leaders in history; one of the channels he used to advance equality was his 
profound work in data visualization. In order to celebrate his legacy of using 
visualizations to do good in the world, the TidyTuesday #DuBoisChallenge calls 
upon users to recreate a selection of Du Bois’ visualizations from the 1900 
Paris Exposition with the aid of modern tools.   

For our project, we’re choosing to focus on the 2021 WEB Du Bois & Juneteenth 
Twitter challenge data - specifically, we’ll be looking at the content and 
metadata of tweets that used the #DuBoisChallenge hashtag to engage with the 
challenge via a plot submission or with commentary. There are a total of 
`r ncol(tweets)` different variables about the tweets and Twitter users - such 
as `like_count`, `lat`, `long`, and `content` - and `r nrow(tweets)` tweets to 
study. From this data, we hope to learn how people engage with culturally 
significant data visualizations in a social media setting. 

## Location Analysis of Tweets

*How does user participation and inter-user interaction in the #DuBoisChallenge 
vary with location?*

### Introduction 

W.E.B. Du Bois is a national hero in American culture - one would expect this 
hero status to result in overwhelming US participation, but the TidyTuesday 
\#DuBoisChallenge attracted interest from all over the world. The goal of these 
sorts of competitions is twofold - to see what sorts of innovative choices 
participants make as well as to form ties and relationships between 
participants. By displaying where tweets come from and which geographical 
regions tend to have inter-user relationships (tags), we can advise future 
competitions on which target audiences are most receptive - the end goal of such 
advice is to allow larger TidyTuesday-like competitions that attract a larger 
audience and form more relationships among the participants.  

Interestingly, Twitter metadata contains two different variables that represent 
a user’s location. There is a `location` variable constructed either from the 
user’s bio or their use of a geo-tag and there are `lat` and `long`: the 
coordinates of the device at the time of tweet publication. Per our question,
we’d like to look at how the tweets are spread around the world and differences 
in user behavior with other users. Specifically, we’ll look at how users “tag” 
other users in their challenge posts by counting the number of \@user
occurrences in each tweet `content` to create `tag_count`.  

### Approach

In our first visualization, we will investigate the `location` character 
variable. Due to the self-reported nature of `location`, many of the entries are 
jokes, ambiguous, or in inconsistent formats. To address the latter problem, we 
had to perform manual cleaning -  US tweets tend to record the state with some 
use of city names while international tweets use a mixture of country and city 
labels. In order to standardize, we converted US cities into their respective 
states and converted significant foreign cities into country groups. While 
comparing states and countries is atypical, the majority of the observed tweets 
are in the US and the use of states allows tweets from other countries to be 
studied. We proceed to count our cleaned `location` variable and narrow the list 
to the top 10 entries. In order to display counts for discrete location names, 
we chose to utilize a bar plot stratified into and colored by regions (SE, SW, 
NE, NW, international) and sorted in descending order within regions. Further, 
we’ve included a text layer with the percentage of each bar out of the total 
tweets from the top 10 locations.

Our second visualization aims to display which areas of the world published the 
most tweets during the challenge and how the number of tags in a tweet might 
vary across the globe: the map format arose as a natural candidate due to the 
need to plot coordinates and our goal of comparing geographical regions. Rather 
than create an overcrowded world map, we instead chose to use the `long` and 
`lat` location variables to form two maps - one of the Northeastern US and one 
of Europe - which each display a layer of country border data, a layer of 
points, and a layer of annotations. Each tweet point is colored, sized, and 
given transparency values via mapping to `tag_count`, a variable formed by 
counting the occurrence of \@user strings within tweet `content`. Further, each 
point is given random noise by geom_jitter() in order to alleviate some of the 
extreme clustering of points around NYC and the southern UK.

### Discussion

Our first plot clearly shows that most of the Twitter challenge activity is 
occurring in the US; eight of the ten locations were US states even though these 
states were being directly compared to entire foreign countries. The only 
international locations in the plot - the UK and Austria - account for merely 
7.88% out of the top 10 locations. This confirms our initial assumption that 
most people interested in and interacting with this challenge are in the US. 
Domestically, four of the top ten locations are northeastern states: an 
unsurprising find when considering population figures and Du Bois’s legacy in 
NYC. Moving forward in our analysis, we chose to focus on the Northeast and 
Europe to study their users and how they may engage each other differently in 
the two regions. 

Our second visualization is a set of two maps of the Northeastern United States 
and Europe with point coloring/sizing by the number of \@tags. One advantage of 
the `long` and `lat` variable over the previous plot’s `location` is that we can 
more precisely display areas where tweet clustering occurs rather than user home 
locations. For example, the Northeast map shows the dominant NYC cluster 
extending outwards towards Newark, NJ while another small cluster exists around 
Baltimore. In Europe, there is a low-density cluster centered in London and 
small clusters in major cultural cities such as Rome and Vienna, but the overall 
number of tweets is far lower than in the US. A glance at the `tag_count` 
mappings proves more fruitful - in both maps, the low tag counts are most 
frequent in all regions, but high tag counts appear exclusively in cluster 
centers. Since these clusters are all cosmopolitan cities, it’s reasonable to 
speculate that their users would have the most ties to other participants and 
thus the ability to tag more people per tweet. However, due to the low number of 
observations and the correlational nature of the data, we lack the evidence to 
make a causal claim that cosmopolitan cities generate more tags (and thus more 
user interactions). Further, our metric to study inter-user interactions, 
`tag_count`, is an imperfect proxy for how users speak. Not every tag is a 
meaningful connection between users and the relationship between tagging and 
user interaction is confounded by this ambiguity.  

## Twitter Posting Mediums and Audience Engagement

*What is the relationship between the device that is used to publish a tweet and how the audience engages with the author?*

### Introduction 

We’re interested in how the different “mediums” of publishing to Twitter are 
related to the success of the tweet. Based on our own anecdotal experiences, we 
believe that tweets from traditional computers may be constructed less 
impulsively than mobile tweets. Further, there are socioeconomic factors tied to 
which device one picks as well as content considerations; one can easily publish 
\#DuBoisChallenge commentary from an iPhone, but a full plot submission would be 
exceedingly difficult. By mapping out how such limitations influence audience 
response, we hope to discover which devices are best-suited for both 
low-visibility commentary and high-visibility challenge submissions.
 
For this question, we intend to explore how various audience approval metrics 
vary with the type of device used by the tweet author. To do this, we’ll begin 
by manipulating the `text` variable - a character of the platform/access point 
that the device used to access Twitter - by parsing it through case_when with 
specific string detection. Then, we will examine `followers` and `like_count` 
and their relationship with `devicetype`. Unlike the other two variables, the 
number of followers is not exclusively set by one tweet, but by the user’s 
long-term success. In recognition of this disparity, we intend to display the 
relationship between `followers` and `devicetype` with groupings by `username` 
and `avg_followers` across all of a user's tweets in the data.

### Approach

Our first plot dives into the relationship between `like_count` and `devicetype` 
by showing side-by-side boxplots faceted by `devicetype`; our goal is to 
directly compare how different platforms may generate likes and boxplots are 
especially well-suited to comparing similar distributions. Further, the measures 
of central tendency - medians and quartiles - are easier to view in boxplot form 
and better communicate the audience’s reaction to a tweet. Boxplots cannot 
accommodate large numbers of groups easily, however, so we chose to narrow our 
analysis to the three device types that form the overwhelming majority of the 
data (iPhone, Android, and Web App). There is an incredibly strong right skew 
in the like counts, but applying a log-transform on the x-axis allows all the 
data to be visible. 

Our second plot shows the distribution of `followers` count per user stratified 
across the three most popular device types. In order to assign each user a 
single follower count and device type,  we use the average number of followers 
across all their tweets (`avg_followers`) and assign a device type based on the 
user’s most common way to post on twitter. Thus, the plot examines the 
relationship between the primary device that a user owns and their average 
number of followers while participating in the TidyTuesday competition. We chose 
to show the distributions of follower count as density plots in order to better 
examine the shapes of the distributions; we’re interested in not only typical 
users, but also “extreme” users from the right tail of the distribution. In 
order to make these extreme values more visible, a log scale is applied to 
average follower counts.

### Discussion

In our first visualization, we immediately see strong skew in all three device 
types and their number of likes - the presence of the logarithmic scale implies 
that a “symmetric” box is actually strongly right-skewed. The strongest right 
skew and highest median number of likes belongs to Web App tweets. One possible 
explanation is the challenge’s format - most tweets are either going to be a 
detailed plot recreation or commentary on another plot. We suspect that plots 
are disproportionately published by web apps due to screen size required to work 
with data visualization - since plots will generally earn more viewership than 
commentary, web app posts are more likely to attain superstar status. 

Our second distribution examines average followers rather than likes in order to 
assess long-term success rather than individual post success. Overall, Android 
tweets have a flat distribution while iPhones and Web Apps have left and right 
skew in the plot, respectively. However, the use of a logarithmic scale means 
that these shapes correspond to strongly right-skewed data. Of these 
distributions, Web App tweets are skewed the furthest to the right followed by 
Androids and iPhones. In terms of modal values in the distributions, iPhones 
have the sharpest and largest peak followed by a slightly lower mode for Web 
Apps and no clear peak for Android tweets. 

The finding from both visualizations that Web App users are strongly skewed 
towards positive audience reception in the short term and long term may be 
indicative of the fact that it is much easier to type out and structure tweets 
on a computer than it is on a phone. In fact, one study from Grammarly showed 
that people make five times as many writing errors on their phone than on a PC. 
This may be one potential reason why tweets authored on a Web App device seem to 
attract more likes than those authored on a mobile device like an Android or 
iPhone – they could be written more methodically and profoundly. Importantly, 
the author may have wanted to craft the tweet more carefully because they had 
more substantive information to share, such as a plot made for the TidyTuesday 
challenge versus a reaction to a plot someone else shared. It thus follows that 
tweets crafted using the Web App would result in more likes, since we would 
expect users to be more engaged in a visualization than simply reaction to a 
visualization. We are unfortunately limited by the lack of a variable to 
easily distinguish challenge submissions and commentary as well as the 
correlational nature of our Twitter data.
