## Dataset

For our dataset, we have chosen to examine the 2021 WEB Du Bois &
Juneteenth Twitter data where each observation is a tweet and the
accompanying metadata such as likes, retweets, and location. The dataset
includes 13 different variables and a total of 445 observations. The
data was collected via scraping from Twitter based on the presence of
the WEB Du Bois challenge hashtag.

We chose this dataset because we appreciate the importance of
celebrating W.E.B DuBois’s legacy in data visualization. The \#DuBois
challenge was a Tidy Tuesday challenge that asked users to recreate his
1900 Paris Exposition today. This exposition included visualizations
that described the income, wealth, employment, and mobility of African
Americans during this time period. By recreating these visualizations
through the \#DuBois challenge, users were able to understand the
conditions of former slaves in the United States and honor the legacy
and the progress of this group. Additionally, these sorts of
visualizations are crucial to understanding modern-day issues in
marginalized groups. From this data, we hope to learn how people engage
with history and data visualization in a social media setting.

We also chose the dataset because it is comprehensive to work with.
There are a variety of different types of variables that can be used for
analysis - logical, double, and character - and the dataset is
well-cleaned. Since the data set is extensive, we know we will be able
to answer a variety of non-overlapping questions that are pertinent to
the world we live in today.

## Questions and Analysis Plan

### Question One

The first question we want to answer is “How does general interest of
the \#DuBois challenge vary geographically?” In order to explore this
inquiry, we will use the `latitude`, `longitude`, and
`retweet_count`variables. To display the geographical distribution of
the data, we will use an external map of the world, on which we will
layer a scatterplot of the location of each tweet. We will use the
latitude and longitude variables to accomplish this, along with the
world map coordinates that come from the map\_data() function in
tidyverse. Then, we will display the count of retweets for each tweet by
mapping the `retweet_count` variable to color, size, or another
scatterplot aesthetic, such that all of the information is very clearly
displayed on the world map.

### Question Two

The second question we want to answer is “How do the number of likes and
followers of a Twitter user vary based on user verification status?” We
will use the variables ‘followers’, ‘verified’ and ‘like\_count’. We
will map `followers` to the x axis, and `like_count` to the y axis, and
then display each point using geom\_point. Then, we will use an
aesthetic such as color or shape to map the verification status of the
tweet author, such that viewers can easily distinguish the two groups.
We will also employ geom\_smooth to point out noticeable trend lines,
and how they differ between verified and unverified users.
